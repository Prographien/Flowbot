# FlowChat Builder - Hackathon Submission

## Project Name
FlowChat Builder

## Tagline
"Build intelligent chatbots visually - No coding required!"

## Problem It Solves
Creating intelligent chatbots traditionally requires extensive coding knowledge and understanding of AI/ML concepts. This barrier prevents many businesses and individuals from implementing chatbot solutions. FlowChat Builder solves this by providing a visual, no-code platform where users can:
- Design chatbot flows using a drag-and-drop interface
- Integrate AI capabilities without writing code
- Test and deploy chatbots instantly
- Use pre-built templates for common use cases
- Customize behavior and appearance easily

## Challenge We Ran Into
One of our major challenges was implementing real-time flow validation and AI response handling. The chatbot flows needed to be both flexible enough to handle complex scenarios and simple enough for non-technical users to understand. We solved this by:
1. Creating a visual node system with clear input/output connections
2. Implementing AI-powered nodes with configurable settings
3. Developing pre-built templates for common use cases
4. Adding real-time chat preview for instant testing
